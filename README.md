* **📥 Flexible Downloading:** Download images in their original, high-quality format with a single click.

* **✂️ Dynamic Resizing:** Need a specific size? Resize images to a custom width before downloading, while automatically preserving the aspect ratio.

* **📱 Fully Responsive Interface:** Built with Bootstrap 5, the user interface provides a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

* **🛡️ Secure by Design:** Your sensitive API keys are kept safe and out of version control in a separate `config.php` file, which is ignored by Git.

* **📄 Easy Pagination:** Effortlessly navigate through multiple pages of search results.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, please follow these steps carefully.

### Prerequisites

* A local web server environment like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/).
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) (optional, but recommended for managing dependencies).

### Installation & Configuration

1.  **Clone the Repository** into your web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP, `www` for WAMP):
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/hashan-7/h7-image-finder.git](https://github.com/hashan-7/h7-image-finder.git)
    cd h7-image-finder
    ```


2.  **(Optional) Install PHP Dependencies:**
    If the project uses libraries like `phpdotenv`, run Composer to install them.
    ```sh
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Create and Configure `config.php`:**

    **⚠️ This is the most important step.** This file is intentionally ignored by Git to protect your secret API keys. You must create it manually.

    * In the project's root directory, create a new file named `config.php`.
    * Copy the code below into this new file and **replace the placeholder values** with your actual credentials.

    ```php
    <?php

    // Pexels API Key
    define('PEXELS_API_KEY', 'YOUR_PEXELS_API_KEY');

    // Google Custom Search API Credentials
    define('GOOGLE_API_KEY', 'YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY');
    define('GOOGLE_CX', 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID');

    ?>
    ```

4.  **Access the Application:**
    Start your WAMP/XAMPP server. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/h7-image-finder/`.
